	abstract     = {Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and their associated microcontaminants have been linked to increased harmful effects on the human health. In this study, the possible relationships between PM2.5, microplastics (MPs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were analyzed in an urban area of Bushehr port, in the northern part of the Persian Gulf. Presence, sources, and health risks of MPs and PAHs in both normal and dusty days were also investigated. The median of PM2.5 and ƩPAHs were 52.8 $\mu$g/m3 and 14.1 ng/m3, respectively, indicating high pollution levels especially in dusty days. The mean level of MPs in urban suspended PM2.5 was 5.2 items/m3. Fragments were the most abundant shape of identified MPs and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was the most plastic types in urban dust of Bushehr port. The results revealed that PM2.5 and MPs may possibly act as a carrier for airborne MPs and PAHs, respectively. In addition, the significant positive relationships between MPs, wind speed and wind direction, confirmed that the MPs transportation were highly controlled by atmospheric condition. Moreover, the source identification methods and trajectory analyses indicated that petrogenic sources from both proximal and distal origins play an important role in the level of PAHs. The results of chronic health risk evaluation via inhalation revealed that PM2.5-bound PAHs had high potential cancer risk in winter, while, the estimated risks for non-carcinogenic PAHs were not considerable. In the case of MPs, the assessment of human intake of MPs via inhalation highlighted the possible risks for habitants.},

Besides, air pollution adversely affects the animals and deteriorates the plant environment. The overarching objective of this review is to explore the previous researches regarding the causes and sources of air pollution, how to control it and its detrimental effects on human health. The definition of air pollution and its sources were introduced extensively. Major air pollutants and their noxious effects were detailed. Detrimental impacts of air pollution on human health and well-being were also presented.},

However, few detailed studies have investigated whether a green rating leads to higher occupant satisfaction with indoor environmental quality (IEQ). This research builds on previous work to address this. Based on the analysis of a subset of the Center for the Built Environment Occupant Indoor Environmental Quality survey database featuring 11,243 responses from 93 Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)-rated office buildings, this study explores the relationships between the points earned in the IEQ category and the satisfaction expressed by occupants with the qualities of their indoor environment. It was found that the achievement of a specific IEQ credit did not substantively increase satisfaction with the corresponding IEQ factor, while the rating level, and the product and version under which certification had been awarded, did not affect workplace satisfaction. There could be several reasons for this, some of which are outside the control of designers and beyond the scope of rating systems based primarily on design intent. The challenges and priorities facing building professionals, researchers and green building certification systems are discussed for the creation of more comfortable, higher performing and healthier green-rated buildings.},

	abstract     = {Background: Ambient air pollution affects neurological function, but its association with schizophrenia risk is unclear. We investigated exposure to nitrogen oxides (NOX) as a whole and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) specifically, as well as PM10, and PM2{\textperiodcentered}5, during childhood and subsequent schizophrenia risk. Methods: People born in Denmark from 1980 to 1984 (N=230 844), who were residing in the country on their tenth birthday, and who had two Danish-born parents were followed-up from their tenth birthday until schizophrenia diagnosis or Dec 31, 2016. Mean daily exposure to each pollutant (NO2, NOX, PM10, and PM2{\textperiodcentered}5) at all of an individual's residential addresses from birth to their tenth birthday was modelled. Incidence rate ratios, cumulative incidence, and population attributable risks were calculated using survival analysis techniques. Findings: We analysed data between Aug 1, 2018, and Nov 15, 2019. Of 230 844 individuals included, 2189 cohort members were diagnosed with schizophrenia during follow-up. Higher concentrations of residential NO2 and NOX exposure during childhood were associated with subsequent elevated schizophrenia risk. People exposed to daily mean concentrations of more than 26{\textperiodcentered}5 $\mu$g/m3 NO2 had a 1{\textperiodcentered}62 (95% CI 1{\textperiodcentered}41–1{\textperiodcentered}87) times increased risk compared with people exposed to a mean daily concentration of less than 14{\textperiodcentered}5 $\mu$g/m3. The absolute risks of developing schizophrenia by the age of 37 years when exposed to daily mean concentrations of more than 26{\textperiodcentered}5 $\mu$g/m3 NO2 between birth and 10 years were 1{\textperiodcentered}45% (95% CI 1{\textperiodcentered}30–1{\textperiodcentered}62%) for men and 1{\textperiodcentered}03% (0{\textperiodcentered}90–1{\textperiodcentered}17) for women, whereas when exposed to a mean daily concentration of less than 14{\textperiodcentered}5 $\mu$g/m3, the risk was 0{\textperiodcentered}80% (95% CI 0{\textperiodcentered}69–0{\textperiodcentered}92%) for men and 0{\textperiodcentered}67% (0{\textperiodcentered}57–0{\textperiodcentered}79) for women. Associations between exposure to PM2{\textperiodcentered}5 or PM10 and schizophrenia risk were less consistent. Interpretation: If the association between air pollution and schizophrenia is causal, reducing ambient air pollution including NO2 and NOX could have a potentially considerable effect on lowering schizophrenia incidence at the population level. Further investigations are necessary to establish a causal relationship.

	abstract     = {Background: Short-term exposure to high level of ambient particulate matters (PM) concentrations has been linked with increased hospital admissions (HA) for schizophrenia. However, evidence is inconclusive about the added effect of multi-day exposure to high-level PM concentration on schizophrenia. This study aims to evaluate the durational effect of PM air pollution wave on schizophrenia. Method: Data on daily HA for schizophrenia, PM (PM2.5 and PM10) and meteorological variables over the period of 2014–2017 was collected in Jining, Shandong, China. Air pollution wave of PM was defined as ≥2 or ≥3 or ≥4 consecutive days with PM concentration ≥90th or ≥92.5th or ≥95th or ≥97.5th percentiles, respectively. A time-series Poisson regression model with duration as the variable of interest was used to evaluate the associations of PM air pollution wave with HA for schizophrenia. Results: A total of 14650 hospital admissions for schizophrenia were identified. Under various air pollution wave definitions, both PM2.5 and PM10 had significant adverse effects on schizophrenia HA. PM2.5 wave defined as ≥2 consecutive days with concentration ≥90th, ≥92.5th, ≥95th and ≥97.5th percentile was associated with 4.8% (2.0%–7.6%), 4.9% (1.9%–7.9%), 5.5% (2.0%–9.2%), and 7.6% (2.9%–12.6%) increase of HA for schizophrenia at lag 6. PM2.5 waves defined as ≥3 consecutive days with concentration ≥90th, ≥92.5th, ≥95th and ≥97.5th percentile respectively corresponded to 5.0% (2.3%–7.8%), 5.1% (1.9%–8.4%), 6.9% (3.0%–10.8%) and 12.0% (5.3%–19.1%) increases in HA for schizophrenia at lag 6. The most significant associations were observed on the sixth day in different lag models. Conclusions: PM air pollution wave was associated with increased risk of hospital admissions for schizophrenia, with stronger associations among married and female patients.},

	abstract     = {In the manufacture of plastic containers, various materials such as additives (for example, plasticizers, stabilizers, antioxidants), polymers (for example, polystyrene [PS], polycarbonate [PC], polyvinyl chloride [PVC]) are widely used. Endocrine disrupting chemicals [EDCs] can migrate as residual monomers (for example, styrene for PS or bisphenol A [BPA] for PC) presented in polymers, as additives (for example, phthalates for PVC) used in polymer manufacturing, and/or as contaminants from the polymers depending on physicochemical conditions such as temperature, UV light, pH, microwave, and mechanical stress. Some phthalates (for example, DEHP, DBP), styrene, or bisphenol have been suspected to have endocrine disrupting effects, but human toxicological effects of these compounds are very controversial. For these reasons, a comprehensive review on toxicological and risk assessment studies for these chemicals (phthalates, BPA, and styrene) was carried out to evaluate their safety in humans. On the basis of exposure estimates for the these chemicals and reference doses (RfDs), we calculated hazard index (HI = chronic daily intake/tolerable daily intake [TDI] or RfD). A HI of less than 1 suggests an exposure lower than the safety limit of the chemicals. We showed that the HI values of these chemicals were lower then 1, but there are one or several exceptions for di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), di-isodecyl phthalate (DIDP), and di-n-octyl phthalate (DnOP; for example, exposure via infant formula, packaged lunch, total exposure), where estimated their HI values are higher than 1, which suggests an exposure higher than the safety limits of the chemicals. However, the HI of BPA was 0.001-0.26 (3.57-1000 times lower than its safety limit), and the HI for styrene was 0.276 (3.62 times lower than its safety limit). In this article, we focused on recent issues concerning the endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) derived from plastic food containers or packaging. This review suggests that the use of plastic food containers might not exceed human safe limits n general with respect to endocrine disruptors aside from the exceptions of the phthalates mentioned earlier. {\textcopyright} 2012 Institute of Food Technologists{\textregistered}.},

All the impacts will be impossible to anticipate. This review is intended to discuss significant factors related to individuals with allergic and respiratory disease. Recent Findings: Recent findings include the increased growth of allergenic plants in response to higher carbon dioxide levels and warmer temperatures. This also contributes to the increased production of pollen as well as the appearance of allergenic species in new climactic areas. Stinging insects will extend their ranges into northern areas where they have not previously been a problem. The shift and extension of pollen seasons with warmer springs and later frosts have already been observed. Recent severe hurricanes and flooding events may be just the harbinger of increasing damp housing exposure related to sea level rise. Evidence is accumulating that indicates the expected higher number of ozone alert days and increased pollution in populated areas is bringing increases in pollen potency. Finally, increased exposure to smoke and particles from wild fires, resulting from heat waves, will contribute to the general increase in respiratory disease. Summary: The practice of allergy being closely aligned with environmental conditions will be especially impacted. Allergists should consider increasing educational activities aimed at making patients more aware of air quality conditions.},

Chem. Ref. Data 21, 411 (1992)]. The work has been carried out under the auspices of the European Community Energy Research and Development Program. Data sheets are presented for some 78 reactions and two tables in which preferred rate parameters are presented for reactions of ethyl, i-propyl, t-butyl, and allyl radicals are given. Each data sheet sets our relevant thermodynamic data, experimental kinetic data, references, and recommended rate parameters with their error limits. A table summarizing the recommended rate data is also given. The new reactions fall into two categories: first, to expand the previous compilation relating largely to the combustion in air of methane, ethane and aromatic compounds; and second, provide data for some of the key radicals involved in the combustion of higher alkanes. {\textcopyright} 1994, American Institute of Physics for the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

It seeks to understand the governance dynamics during conflict in the non-government-controlled parts of Syria. It pays particular attention to civil society and state building processes. In doing so, the study spans historical and geographical width. Historically, to understand the roots of the conflict, it assesses the state-civil society-market dynamics of governance in Syria prior to 2011. Nevertheless, its focus is on contemporary Syria between March, 2011 and May, 2014. Geographically, its particular attention and in-depth analysis is on three areas in the non-government-controlled parts: Al-Raqqa (the city), Deir Ez-zor (Al-Mayadeen and the city) and Aleppo (the city).},

The growing knowledge on mediators and triggered pathways has advanced our understanding of the interactions along the gut-brain axis. Gut bacteria produce neuroactive compounds and can modulate neuronal function, plasticity and behavior. Furthermore, intestinal microorganisms impact the host's metabolism and immune status which in turn affect neuronal pathways in the enteric and central nervous systems. Here, we discuss the recent insights from human studies and animal models on the bi-directional communication along the microbiome-gut-brain axis in both acute and chronic brain diseases.},

The aim of the present study was to investigate potential associations between persistent allergic symptoms in children, which have increased markedly in developed countries over the past three decades, and the concentration of phthalates in dust collected from their homes. This investigation is a case-control study nested within a cohort of 10,852 children. From the cohort, we selected 198 cases with persistent allergic symptoms and 202 controls without allergic symptoms. A clinical and a technical team investigated each child and her or his environment. We found higher median concentrations of butyl benzyl phthalate (BBzP) in dust among cases than among controls (0.15 vs. 0.12 mg/g dust). Analyzing the case group by symptoms showed that BBzP was associated with rhinitis (p = 0.001) and eczema (p = 0.001), whereas di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) was associated with asthma (p = 0.022). Furthermore, dose-response relationships for these associations are supported by trend analyses. This study shows that phthalates, within the range of what is normally found in indoor environments, are associated with allergic symptoms in children. We believe that the different associations of symptoms for the three major phthalates - BBzP, DEHP, and di-n-butyl phthalate - can be explained by a combination of chemical physical properties and toxicologic potential. Given the phthalate exposures of children worldwide, the results from this study of Swedish children have global implications.},

	abstract     = {The long term Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) record provides a critical historical perspective on vegetation dynamics necessary for global change research. Despite the proliferation of new sources of global, moderate resolution vegetation datasets, the remote sensing community is still struggling to create datasets derived from multiple sensors that allow the simultaneous use of spectral vegetation for time series analysis. To overcome the non-stationary aspect of NDVI, we use an artificial neural network (ANN) to map the NDVI indices from AVHRR to those from MODIS using atmospheric, surface type and sensor-specific inputs to account for the differences between the sensors. The NDVI dynamics and range of MODIS NDVI data at 1 is matched and extended through the AVHRR record. Four years of overlap between the two sensors is used to train a neural network to remove atmospheric and sensor specific effects on the AVHRR NDVI. In this paper, we present the resulting continuous dataset, its relationship to MODIS data, and a validation of the product.},

	abstract     = {This study investigated the role of nocturnal melatonin secretion in the cognitive performance of diurnal animals. An initial experiment measured the cognitive performance in Indian house crows treated for 11 days with 12 h light at 1.426 W/m2 (∼150 lux) coupled with 12 h of 0.058 W/m2 (∼6-lux) dim light at night (dLAN) or with absolute darkness (0 lux dark night, LD). dLAN treatment significantly decreased midnight melatonin levels and negatively impacted cognitive performance. Subsequently, the role of exogenous melatonin (50 $\mu$g; administered intraperitoneally half an hour before the night began) was assessed on the regulation of cognitive performance in two separate experimental cohorts of crows kept under dLAN; LD controls received vehicle. Exogenous melatonin restored its mid-night levels under dLAN at par with those under LD controls, and improved the cognitive performance, as measured in the innovative problem-solving, and spatial and pattern learning-memory efficiency tests in dLAN-treated crows. There were concurrent molecular changes in the cognition-associated brain areas, namely the hippocampus, nidopallium caudolaterale and midbrain. In particular, the expression levels of genes involved in neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity (bdnf, dcx, egr1, creb), and dopamine synthesis and signalling (th, drd1, drd2, darpp32, taar1) were restored to LD control levels in crows treated with illuminated nights and received melatonin. These results demonstrate that the maintenance of nocturnal melatonin levels is crucial for an optimal higher-order brain function in diurnal animals in the face of an environmental threat, such as light pollution.},

	abstract     = {While fuel combustion in oxygen-enriched environments provides a number of significant advantages, such as reduced nitrogen oxide emissions and high carbon dioxide purity for carbon sequestration, it is characterized by different physico-chemical oxidation behavior than combustion in air. Compared to nitrogen, carbon dioxide has different specific heat and effective Lewis number, and is chemically more active. Therefore, chemical mechanisms developed for the oxidation of fuel/air mixtures can fail to predict targets of interest for oxy-combustion accurately. In this study, a chemical mechanism of methane, which has been previously validated with data from experiments using air, is evaluated in terms of its prediction accuracy at oxy-conditions by comparing against available literature data. The validation takes various combustion properties into account, including ignition delay times, laminar burning velocities, and extinction strain rates, and covers a wide range of experimental conditions with respect to temperature, pressure, equivalence ratio, and carbon dioxide concentration. As additional targets, extinction strain rates of non-premixed oxy-methane flames are determined in a counterflow burner at conditions, where literature data have not yet been reported. The extensive validation demonstrates that the mechanism is able to describe oxy-methane combustion with reasonable prediction accuracy. For further insights into the underlying kinetics of diffusion flames of methane in oxy-atmosphere compared to its oxidation in air, reaction path and sensitivity analyses are performed using the validated mechanism. Notable differences between both combustion regimes are observed in the branching ratios of H-abstraction reactions by OH and H radicals and in the consumption channels of singlet methylene, which is a key species in the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.},

Indoor air chemistry has many similarities to, but also some differences from, that in the ambient atmosphere. Indoors, there is less light, more available surface area and a time scale for reaction that is limited by the exchange rate with outdoors. Despite these differences, there is still a wide range of gas-phase and surface reactions and also partitioning between gas and particle phases. Consequently, indoor chemical reactions produce a myriad of complex, multifunctional products, many of which are thought to be harmful to health. Most research in this area has been focused on the reactions between ozone and terpene species. Ozone can ingress from outdoors, whereas terpenes are components of many indoor products such as cleaning fluids, air fresheners and fragrances. These reactions lead to a wide range of both short- and longer-lived species. Research is becoming increasingly focused on the impact of human activities such as cooking and cleaning on indoor air chemistry. The importance of surfaces is also becoming apparent, both in terms of providing a permanent or temporary sink for species that undergo deposition, but also as a means of forming new products.},

	abstract     = {There is growing concern about health effects of high air pollution in less-developed countries. Children represent a population at increased risk for air pollution–related respiratory conditions. This study investigated the relationship between high ambient air pollution exposure and respiratory health of young schoolchildren. From 2014 to 2016 in Jinan, China, 2532 primary school children in grades three to five from two different schools with different levels of air pollution were included in the study. Levels of ambient air pollution exposure including PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, CO and O3 were measured continuously at the two schools. A questionnaire about children's respiratory health was conducted every year. Among them, about 150 randomly selected children also performed lung function tests two times a year at the beginning of November and middle of December. Annual average exposure levels of PM2.5 (66.8–79.1 vs 90.0–107.7 $\mu$g/m3), PM10 (129.5–177.3 vs 198.1–218.6 $\mu$g/m3), NO2 (45.3–53.2 vs 45.0–56.2 $\mu$g/m3), SO2 (29.8–56.5 vs 40.5–80.3 $\mu$g/m3), CO (1.3–1.5 vs 1.4–1.7 mg/m3) and O3 (84.8–120.2 vs 61.1–128.1 $\mu$g/m3) in the heavy pollution primary school were significantly higher than the light one. The higher air pollution exposure was related to increased prevalence of respiratory diseases of young children in the last year, especially allergic rhinitis. The increased odds of lung function impairment associated with exposure to higher air pollution, could be up to 171.5% (aOR = 2.715; 95% CI = 1.915–3.849) for PEF < 75% predicted in 2014. However, after short-term exposure for 1.5 month or a week, paired comparison for parameters of the same child showed different results. The association between high ambient air pollution exposure and respiratory health of young children is closely related to exposure time and dose and may be fluctuate and complex.},

	abstract     = {Ultimate factors such as food availability and weather create optimal windows of time for birds to reproduce. However, within a given year, birds must rely upon proximate environmental information such as photoperiod, food, temperature, social cues and other factors to anticipate when that window will occur and prepare physiologically for breeding. While avian responses to photoperiod are relatively well understood, less is known about how birds use non-photoperiodic information in reproductive timing decisions – even though understanding how birds use non-photic cues is an important component of predicting their responses to global change. We review research on the regulation of reproductive physiology and clutch initiation by non-photic cues within and across avian species. We evaluate hypotheses in the literature about the integration of photoperiodic and non-photic cues in reproductive timing and about differences in non-photic cue-use between the sexes and across species. We show how regulation of reproduction by non-photic cues may influence species' responses to climate change and highlight research opportunities moving forward.},

Consequently, bioaerosol abundance and biodiversity can be underestimated, making it more difficult to link specific bioaerosol components to diseases and human health risk. Owing to the low biomass in air samples, it remains a challenge to obtain a representative microbiological sample to recover sufficient DNA for downstream analyses. Improved sampling methods are particularly crucial, especially for investigating viral communities, owing to the extremely low biomass of viral particles in the air compared with other environments. Without detailed information about sampling, characterization and enumeration techniques, interpretation of exposure level is very difficult. Despite this, bioaerosol research has been enhanced by molecular tools, especially next-generation sequencing approaches that have allowed faster and more detailed characterization of air samples.},

Increased costs have prompted energy conservation and more stringent operational standards for buildings. Tight building envelopes reduce energy losses, but force reassessment of building designs and retrofits. The paradigm has shifted from "ventilation" to "comfort" to "indoor environmental quality" (IEQ). Various air treatment technologies can be used for control of trace contaminants. Conventional processes, such as sorption, filtration, and disinfection, are combined with advanced treatment processes (ATP), such as photocatalytic oxidation to oxidize volatile organic compounds (VOCs), bipolar air ionization to agglomerate particulate matter (PMx), and ultraviolet disinfection to inactivate bioaerosols. Modular hybrid devices are integrated into engineered systems to control low levels of these contaminants. The extensive early development of these technologies is supplemented with improved diagnostic techniques applied to domestic, institutional, and commercial installations. {\textcopyright} 2007 NRC Canada.},

Therefore, it is critical to characterize exposures to air pollution in indoor environments in order to conduct risk and health impact assessments. Not all indoor environments are the same, hence their contributions to personal exposure will differ. This chapter discusses different factors that might affect exposure to air pollution indoors, including time spent indoors, the influence of outdoor air and the presence of indoor sources of pollution. These factors are also influenced by human, societal and environmental characteristics, e.g. gender, age, employment status and lifestyle. Geopolitics will also influence the contribution of indoor exposures to total exposure, since the economic development of countries affects housing stock, access to energy, employment opportunities and transport infrastructure, all relevant to exposure. Regional climatological conditions will also affect indoor and total exposure to air pollution. This chapter describes the methodology for determining the contribution of indoor environments to total exposure and doses of air pollution. Factors relevant to exposure in indoor environments are discussed, including exposures in developing countries and for sensitive populations.},

We report field measurements of rBC dry and wet deposition rates during summer 2017 at the Southern Great Plains site in Oklahoma. On average, dry deposition of rBC is 0.3 ± 0.2 mm/s. We estimate a wet deposition flux of 2,600 ng{\textperiodcentered}m−2{\textperiodcentered}hr−1 over the 148.5 mm of rainfall observed. These data indicate a composite lifetime of 7–11 days.},

Presented early in the book is theory as support for the applications that follow; including a synthesized review of the significant literature on controlling air pollution. Practical applications-largely from the author's own experience-deal with 1) How to conduct indoor air quality investigations in both residences and public access buildings, 2) Indoor air quality mitigation practice, and 3) Case histories. This book will be very useful to consultants and other professionals who grapple to solve real world problems. And it will make an excellent textbook for new courses in indoor air quality. Indoor Air Pollution Control will be used for control and prevention of contaminated air in homes, apartment buildings, office buildings (large and small), hospitals, auditoriums, and other public buildings.}

In healthcare facilities, several studies have reported data analysis and case studies to improve users' health. Nowadays, although many studies have been conducted related to the biological and physical risks, the chemical risks have been less investigated and only in some specific functional areas of the hospitals. Starting from some systematic reviews and research works, this paper aims to list the best healthy practices for an adequate IAQ in inpatient wards. In particular, the decalogue lists the strategies related to chemical pollution, starting from design and management, with a focus on (a) localization of hospitals and inpatient rooms, (b) hospital room, (c) microclimatic parameters, (d) ventilation systems, (e) materials and finishing, (f) furniture and equipment, (g) cleaning products and activities, (h) maintenance and (i) management activities, and (l) users and workers. The multidisciplinary approach emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary knowledge and skills aimed to find solutions able to protect users' health status. The design and management decision-making, ranging from the adequate choices of construction site and hospital exposure, finishing materials, cleaning and maintenance activities, etc., which can affect the IAQ must be carried out based on scientific research and data analysis.},

Here, we investigated the occurrence, chemical composition, shape, and size of MPs in aircraft sampling campaigns flying within and above the planetary boundary layer (PBL). The results showed that MPs were present with concentrations ranging from 1.5 MPs m−3 above rural areas to 13.9 MPs m−3 above urban areas. MPs represented up to almost one third of the total amount of microparticles collected. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy allowed identifying seven types of MPs with the highest diversity corresponding to urban areas. Atmospheric transport and deposition simulations were performed using the HYbrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. Air mass trajectory analyses showed that MPs could be transported more than 1000 km before being deposited. This pioneer study is the first evidence of the microplastic presence above PBL and their potential long-range transport from their point of release even crossing distant borders.},

	abstract     = {Objective: Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) adversely affect human health. Our objective was to determine the association of EDC exposure with earlier age of menopause. Methods: Cross-sectional survey using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 1999 to 2008 (n = 31,575 females).Eligible participants included: menopausal women >30 years of age; not currently pregnant, breastfeeding, using hormonal contraception; no history of bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy. Exposures, defined by serum lipid and urine creatinine-adjusted measures of EDCs, data were analyzed: > 90th percentile of the EDC distribution among all women, log-transformed EDC level, and decile of EDC level. Multi linear regression models considered complex survey design characteristics and adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, smoking, body mass index. EDCs were stratified into long (>1 year), short, and unknown half-lives; principle analyses were performed on those with long half-lives as well as phthalates, known reproductive toxicants. Secondary analysis determined whether the odds of being menopausal increased with EDC exposure among women aged 45-55 years. Findings: This analysis examined 111 EDCs and focused on known reproductive toxicants or chemicals with half-lives >1 year. Women with high levels of $\beta$-hexachlorocyclohexane, mirex, p,p′-DDE, 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-heptachlorodibenzofuran, mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) and mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate, polychlorinated biphenyl congeners -70, -99, -105, -118, -138, -153, -156, -170, and -183 had mean ages of menopause 1.9 to 3.8 years earlier than women with lower levels of these chemicals. EDC-exposed women were up to 6 times more likely to be menopausal than non-exposed women. Conclusions: This study of a representative sample of US women documents an association between EDCs and earlier age at menopause. We identified 15 EDCs that warrant closer evaluation because of their persistence and potential detrimental effects on ovarian function. Earlier menopause can alter the quantity and quality of a woman's life and has profound implications for fertility, human reproduction, and our global society.},

In this study, we measured concentrations and profiles of 9 phthalate esters in indoor dust samples collected from six cities in China (n = 75). For comparison, we also analyzed samples collected from Albany, New York, USA (n = 33). The results indicated that concentrations, except for dicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP) and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), and profiles of phthalate esters varied significantly between the two countries. Concentrations of diethyl phthalate (DEP), di-n-hexyl phthalate (DNHP), and benzyl butyl phthalate (BzBP) were 5 to 10 times higher in dust samples collected from Albany than those from the Chinese cities. In contrast, concentrations of di-iso-butyl phthalate (DIBP) in dust samples from Albany were 5 times lower than those from the Chinese cities. We estimated the daily intake (DI) of phthalate esters through the routes of dust ingestion and dermal dust absorption. The extent of contribution of indoor dust to human exposures varied, depending on the type of phthalate esters. The contribution of dust to DEHP exposure was 2-5% and 10-58% of the estimated total DIs in China and the USA, respectively. On the basis of the estimates of total DIs of phthalates, extrapolated from urinary metabolite concentrations, the contributions of inhalation, dermal absorption, and dietary intake to total DIs were estimated. The results indicated that dietary intake is the main source of exposure to DEHP (especially in China), whereas dermal exposure was a major source for DEP. This is the first study to elucidate sources of human exposure to phthalates among the general population in China. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract     = {Modern populations spend the majority of their time indoors. For the most active working age population, the fraction of time spent indoors is around 85%, whereas for small children and the sedentary elderly the figure approaches 100%. Indoor air is, of course, particularly affected by indoor sources. Nevertheless, outdoor air is a significant contributor to indoor levels of the main classical air pollutants such as ultrafine and fine particles and nitrogen oxides, and often the only source of others such as ozone and sulfur dioxide. Indoor air quality is created by complex processes that involve outdoor air, ventilation, building tightness, filtration, mixtures of pollution, occupant behaviour and indoor emission sources ranging through building materials, soil, occupants, and customer products and appliances used in the building. The literature shows convincingly that the role played by outdoor air is probably the most significant single factor at the population level. In developed countries, the building stock is relatively well insulated, affecting the air exchange rates and infiltration processes. This chapter presents an overview of recent evidence on infiltration rates of outdoor air pollution and processes that affect them.},

	abstract     = {A fair-weather electric field has been observed near the Earth's surface for over two centuries. The field is sustained by charge generation in distant disturbed weather regions, through current flow in the global electric circuit. Conventionally, the fair-weather part of the global circuit has disregarded clouds, but extensive layer clouds, important to climate, are widespread globally. Such clouds are not electrically inert, becoming charged at their upper and lower horizontal boundaries from vertical current flow, in a new electrical regime - neither fair nor disturbed weather; hence it is described here as semi-fair weather. Calculations and measurements show the upper cloud boundary charge is usually positive, the cloud interior positive and the lower cloud boundary negative, with the upper charge density larger, but of the same magnitude (∼nC m -2) as cloud base. Globally, the total positive charge stored by layer clouds is approximately 10 5 C, which, combined with the positive charge in the atmospheric column above the cloud up to the ionosphere, balances the total negative surface charge of the fair-weather regions. Extensive layer clouds are, therefore, an intrinsic aspect of the global circuit, and the resulting natural charging of their cloud droplets is a fundamental atmospheric feature.},

Aerosol is generated by the ozonolysis reaction of monoterpenes ($\alpha$-pinene, $\beta$-pinene, 3-carene, and limonene) and sesquiterpenes ($\beta$-caryophyllene, $\alpha$-humulene, and $\alpha$-cedrene) in a 10 m3 temperature-controlled Teflon smog chamber. In some cases, a self-seeding technique is used, which enables high particle concentrations with the desired diameters without compromising particle composition and purity. The monoterpene SOA is excellent CCN material, and it activates similarly (average activation diameter equals 48 ± 8 nm at 1% supersaturation for the species used in this work) to highly water-soluble organic species. Its effective solubility in water was estimated to be in the range of 0.07-0.40 g solute/g H2O. CCN measurements for sesquiterpene SOA (average activation diameter equals 120 ± 20 nm at 1% supersaturation for the species used in this work) show that it is less CCN active than monoterpene SOA. The initial terpene mixing ratio (between 3 and 100 ppb) does not affect the CCN activation for freshly generated SOA. Copyright 2005 by the American Geophysical Union.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Carbonyl compounds are the crucial intermediate species for the autocatalytic production of OH. For example, in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere it is calculated based on data assimilation analysis of Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy Experiment (ATTMOS) data that CH3 production due to the degradation of carbonyls contributes around 40% to the overall production of CH3, a key initiation step for HOx production, with the contribution due to the photolysis of CH3CHO being comparable to that of acetone. So correctly modeling the alkyl radical concentrations is of central importance and has not be given the attention it deserves to date. The reactions of carbonyls with Br and Cl are also major sources of HBr and HCl. In short, carbonyl compounds play a central role in atmospheric chemistry close to the tropopause, and this is directly relevant to issues such as the assessment of the impact of air traffic, and ozone depletion.},

The goal of the chemistry data assimilation is to combine an atmospheric-chemistry model and actual observations to produce the best estimate of the chemistry of the atmosphere. The observational dataset collected during the past decades is an unprecedented expansion of our knowledge of the atmosphere. The exploitation of these data is the best way to advance our understanding of atmospheric chemistry, and to develop chemistry models for chemistry-climate prediction. The assimilation focuses on estimating the state of the chemistry in a chemically and dynamically consistent manner (if the model allows online interactions between chemistry and dynamics). In so doing, we can: produce simultaneous and chemically consistent estimates of all species (including model parameters), observed and unobserved; fill in data voids; test the photochemical theories used in the chemistry models. In this paper, the Hilbert space is first formulated from the geometric structure of the Banach space, followed by the development of the adjoint operator in Hilbert space. The principle of the adjoint method is described, followed by two examples which show the relationship of the gradient of the cost function with respect to the Output vector and the gradient of the cost function with respect to the input vector. Applications to chemistry data assimilation are presented for both continuous and discrete cases. The 4D data variational adjoint method is then tested in the assimilation of stratospheric chemistry using a simple catalytic ozone-destruction mechanism, and the test results indicate that the performance of the assimilation method is good.}

In this study a neural network using Quickprop learning and one hidden layer with eight nodes was able to reproduce the CH4-N2O correlation with a correlation coefficient between simulated and training values of 0.9995. Such an accurate representation of tracer-tracer correlations allows more use to be made of long-term datasets to constrain chemical models.

Between 1998 and 2004 the stratospheric loading of HCl was relatively constant, with some month to month fluctuation; this was followed by a more pronounced decrease in HCl since 2004. We use probability distribution functions ( PDFs) and scatter diagrams for validation and bias characterization of Aura Microwave Limb Sounder ( MLS) HCl retrievals. Both these methods allow us to use large statistical samples and do not require correlative measurements to be colocated in space and time. The bias between the Halogen Occultation Experiment ( HALOE) and Aura MLS is greatest above the 525 K ( similar to 21 km) isentropic surface. The global average mean bias between Aura and the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment ( ACE) for January 2005 was 2% and between Aura MLS and HALOE was 14%. The widths of the PDFs are a measure of the spatial variability and measurement precision. The Aura MLS HCl PDFs are consistently wider than those for ACE and HALOE, this reflects the retrieval uncertainties. The median observation uncertainty for Aura MLS v1.51 HCl is 12%, and the median ACE v2.2 uncertainty is 8%. We also connect Aura MLS HCl with the heritage of HALOE HCl by using neural networks to learn the interinstrument biases and provide a seamless HCl record from the launch of the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite ( UARS) in 1991 to the present.},

	abstract     = {A three-dimensional (3D) radiative-dynamical-chemical model has been developed and used to study the evolution of trace gases in the Arctic lower stratosphere during winter 1989-1990. A series of 10-day model integrations were performed throughout this period. The model includes a comprehensive scheme of gas phase chemical reactions as well as a parameterization of heterogeneous reactions occurring on polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) surfaces. An important element of a 3D chemical model is the transport scheme. In this study the transport of chemical species is achieved by a non diffusive method well suited to the preservation of sharp gradients. During the winter studied temperatures were cold enough for the formation of both type I and type II polar stratospheric clouds from early December to early February. Model simulations in late December show that inside the polar vortex air is rapidly processed by polar stratospheric clouds converting HCl and ClONO2 to active chlorine. The possibility of ozone destruction depends strongly on the amount of sunlight. In early February an average ozone loss of 15 ppbv (parts per billion by volume) /day is predicted in PSC-processed air at 50 hPa. giving a column loss of just under 1 DU/day. This loss increases to 25 ppbv/day if PSCs persist until March with a column loss of around 1.5 DU/day. The relatively small magnitude of the ozone loss predicted in the model, compared to the variability of ozone induced by dynamics, highlights the problems in identifying the signature of chemical ozone loss in the Arctic. In future years significant ozone depletion could occur if PSCs persist until late March. rhe efficiency of the catalytic cycles responsible for the ozone loss has been analyzed as a function of latitude, altitude and time. In general, the cycle involving ClO + ClO is the dominant loss mechanism in the polar lower stratosphere. Cycles involving BrO can make a relatively large contribution early in the season and when the levels of CIO are low. The cycle initiated by ClO + O destroys ozone at altitudes above 30 hPa but the loss is compensated, to some extent, by in situ ozone production. The results for trace species are validated, where possible, by comparison with the available measurements, although the sparse nature of the observations does not effectively constrain the model.},

Since a detailed treatment of all processes involved is time consuming, many approximations are usually made. An approximation used in virtually all GCM radiation codes that extend into the middle atmosphere is that the atmosphere can be treated as plane parallel. This approximation breaks down when the sun is close to the horizon and does not apply for large solar zenith angles. This paper shows that this approximation leads to a very serious underestimate of solar heating rates in the polar regions. Ignoring spherical effects, and in particular the heating due to absorption at zenith angles greater than 90-degrees, gives rise to a very different latitudinal gradient in the diurnally averaged heating rates calculated at the equinox.

Accounting for the heating that occurs at zenith angles greater than 90-degrees is shown to be important.},

This run produces high values of active chlorine within the polar vortex, for example mixing ratios of ClO(X) (=CL+CLO+CL2O2) of 1.8ppbv are calculated after six days of integration, with correspondingly low values of HCl and CLONO2. During warm periods of this model run, when the PSC reactions are not active, the ClO(X) is converted slowly back into ClONO2. Chemical loss of ozone in January in the model is small.}

We have considered reactions on both sulfate aerosols and on polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs), It is shown that the hydrolysis of BrONO2 on sulfate aerosols enhances the HOBr concentration, which in turn enhances the OH and HO2 concentrations, thereby reducing the HCl lifetime and concentration. The hydrolysis of BrONO2 leads to a nighttime production of HOBr, making HOBr a major nighttime bromine reservoir. The photolysis of HOBr gives a rapid increase in the OH and HO2 concentration at dawn, as was recently observed by Salawitch et al. {[}1994]. The increase in the OH and HO2 concentration, and the decrease in the HCl concentration, leads to additional ozone depletion at all latitudes and for all season. At temperatures below 210 K the bulk phase reaction of HOBr with HCl in sulfate aerosols becomes important. The most important heterogeneous bromine reactions on polar stratospheric clouds are the mixed halogen reactions of HCl with HOBr and BrONO2 and of HBr with HOCl and ClONO2.},

This technique involves integrating a photochemical package along a large number of independent trajectories to produce a Lagrangian view of the atmosphere. Although Lagrangian chemical modeling with trajectories is an established procedure, this extension of integrating chemistry along a large number of domain-filling trajectories is a novel technique. This technique is complementary to three-dimensional Eulerian chemical transport modeling and avoids spurious mixing caused by low resolutions or diffusive transport schemes in these models. We illustrate the technique by studying the chlorine activation in the Arctic winter lower stratosphere. A photochemical model was integrated along large ensembles of calculated trajectories between 20 and 100 mbar for the 1991/1992 winter in order to produce a three-dimensional chemical picture. Large amounts of chlorine was activated at low altitudes (80 to 100 mbar) as well as altitudes near 50 mbar. This activated air was well contained at all levels, with little indication of mixing into lower latitudes. Model results for early January 1992 were compared to daily Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) ClO observations at 465 K. The structure and evolution of the activated chlorine was well reproduced, giving faith in the technique, although absolute modeled ClO amounts were smaller than the MLS data. A larger number of domain-filling isentropic trajectories were also run at 475 K to produce a higher-resolution picture of vortex evolution in late January 1992. The model successfully reproduced the wave breaking events which characterized this period causing transport of activated air to lower latitudes.},

There was no significant difference in the overall prevalence of cataract between the two villages, The male population in each village was subdivided into those who worked predominantly indoors and those who worked predominantly outdoors, All women worked outdoors, There was no significant difference in the prevalence of cataract between the male outdoor workers in the two villages, The indoor workers in the village with higher UV light exposure (Hunza) had a significantly higher cataract prevalence (p<0.001) than the indoor workers in the village with lower UV light exposure (Nomol), In the village with lower UV light exposure (Nomol), the male outdoor workers had a significantly higher prevalence of cataract than the male indoor workers (p<0.001), There was no significant difference in the prevalence of cataract between the male indoor and outdoor workers in the village with higher UV light exposure (Hunza), Overall, these results are not strongly supportive of UV light being of major importance in cataractogenesis, but they are consistent with a saturation model of UV light as a risk factor for cataract formation.}

This is because the two differential equations solved numerically by DeMajistre et al. have been which reduced them to only one simple expression. The effects of refraction on stratospheric chemistry calculated with this new model are shown to be greatest in the polar lower stratosphere close to the onset and completion of polar night. The main effect is to change the shape of the seasonal cycle of reactive species produced by photolysis such as NO, NO2, OH, HO2, Cl, ClO, Br, and BrO during the onset and completion of polar night.}

With only a 1-2% yield of HBr the modelled HBr mixing ratio between 20-30 km increases from around 0.5 parts per 10(12) by volume (pptv) to 1-2 pptv. This brings the model into agreement with recent balloon-borne observations of stratospheric HBr. Should BrO + OK produce HBr with around 1-2% yield then this reaction will dominate HBr production between 20-35 km. As the main loss of HBr is reaction with OH this will lead to steady state HBr:BrO partitioning which is independent of other species, and temperature.},

Moreover, solving inverse problems with hidden physics is often prohibitively expensive and requires different formulations and elaborate computer codes. Machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative, but training deep neural networks requires big data, not always available for scientific problems. Instead, such networks can be trained from additional information obtained by enforcing the physical laws (for example, at random points in the continuous space-time domain). Such physics-informed learning integrates (noisy) data and mathematical models, and implements them through neural networks or other kernel-based regression networks. Moreover, it may be possible to design specialized network architectures that automatically satisfy some of the physical invariants for better accuracy, faster training and improved generalization. Here, we review some of the prevailing trends in embedding physics into machine learning, present some of the current capabilities and limitations and discuss diverse applications of physics-informed learning both for forward and inverse problems, including discovering hidden physics and tackling high-dimensional problems.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

	abstract     = {We use an ensemble of surface (EPA CSN, IMPROVE, SEARCH, AERONET), aircraft (SEAC4RS), and satellite (MODIS, MISR) observations over the southeast US during the summer-fall of 2013 to better understand aerosol sources in the region and the relationship between surface particulate matter (PM) and aerosol optical depth (AOD). The GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model (CTM) with 25 × 25 km2 resolution over North America is used as a common platform to interpret measurements of different aerosol variables made at different times and locations. Sulfate and organic aerosol (OA) are the main contributors to surface PM2.5 (mass concentration of PM finer than 2.5 $\mu$m aerodynamic diameter) and AOD over the southeast US. OA is simulated successfully with a simple parameterization, assuming irreversible uptake of low-volatility products of hydrocarbon oxidation. Biogenic isoprene and monoterpenes account for 60 % of OA, anthropogenic sources for 30 %, and open fires for 10 %. 60 % of total aerosol mass is in the mixed layer below 1.5 km, 25 % in the cloud convective layer at 1.5-3 km, and 15 % in the free troposphere above 3 km. This vertical profile is well captured by GEOS-Chem, arguing against a high-altitude source of OA. The extent of sulfate neutralization (f = [NH<inf>4</inf><sup>+</sup>]/(2[SO<inf>4</inf><sup>2-</sup>] + [NO<inf>3</inf><sup>-</sup>]) is only 0.5-0.7 mol mol<sup>-1</sup> in the observations, despite an excess of ammonia present, which could reflect suppression of ammonia uptake by OA. This would explain the long-term decline of ammonium aerosol in the southeast US, paralleling that of sulfate. The vertical profile of aerosol extinction over the southeast US follows closely that of aerosol mass. GEOS-Chem reproduces observed total column aerosol mass over the southeast US within 6 %, column aerosol extinction within 16 %, and space-based AOD within 8-28 % (consistently biased low). The large AOD decline observed from summer to winter is driven by sharp declines in both sulfate and OA from August to October. These declines are due to shutdowns in both biogenic emissions and UV-driven photochemistry. Surface PM<inf>2.5</inf> shows far less summer-to-winter decrease than AOD and we attribute this in part to the offsetting effect of weaker boundary layer ventilation. The SEAC4RS aircraft data demonstrate that AODs measured from space are consistent with surface PM<inf>2.5</inf>. This implies that satellites can be used reliably to infer surface PM<inf>2.5</inf> over monthly timescales if a good CTM representation of the aerosol vertical profile is available.},

	abstract     = {Only few studies investigated the input of microplastic particles via the atmosphere, so far. Here, we present results on microplastic concentrations in the atmospheric deposition in the metropolitan region of Hamburg. In total, six investigation sites were equipped with three bulk precipitation samplers each and sampled biweekly over 12 weeks (12/17–03/18). Three sites were located in a rural area south of Hamburg comprising one open field site and two throughfall sites under beech/oak and Douglas fir forest canopy, respectively. Three further sites were selected within the city following a transect from north to south representing urban sites of varying degrees concerning population, traffic and industrial pressures. Particles and fibers were counted under UV light within a photo box and under a fluorescence microscope (Axio Lab A.1, Zeiss). Results show that microplastic particles are ubiquitous at all sites. A median abundance between 136.5 and 512.0 microplastic particles per m2/day has been found over the sampling period. This equals a mean microplastic abundance of 275 particles/m2/day $\mu$Raman spectroscopy showed that polyethylenes/ethylvinyl acetate copolymers are dominating significantly (48.8 and 22.0%, respectively), 16 particles analyzed (14.6%)were identified as contamination from PE (polyethylene)samplers. In contrast to other studies, fragments were significantly dominating compared to fibers. The spatial distribution comparing the urban sites concentrations followed in the order from high to low: “north” (Henstedt-Ulzburg, low population density, suburb)– “center” (University; large population density)– “south” (Wilhelmsburg, middle population density, port and industrial facilities)with highly varying concentrations within the time series. Surprisingly, the rural sites in the southern part of Hamburg showed highest concentrations (Douglas fir > open field > beech/oak). This finding is most likely a result of factors such as the comb out capacity of the different forest types and/or direct input pathways from the agricultural areas and the nearby highway.},

	abstract     = {This paper highlights the importance of halogen-catalyzed methane oxidation in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. The calculated rate of methane oxidation is increased by at least 20% in the upper troposphere when halogen catalysis is included. In the lower stratosphere, approximately 25% of methane oxidation can be initiated by chlorine; the precise fraction is very temperature dependent. Including halogen-catalyzed methane oxidation increases the HOx and ClOx concentrations and decreases the NOx concentration. The calculated enhancement in the HOx concentration due to halogen-catalyzed methane oxidation is around 10-15% in the lower stratosphere; and around 20% in the upper troposphere. The decrease in the NOx concentration is around 10% in the upper troposphere. The enhancement in the ClOx concentration is around 7-10% in the lower stratosphere. The increase in the calculated HOx and ClOx concentrations and the decrease in the NOx concentration lead to a enhancement in the calculated O-3 loss. The additional O-3 loss calculated is most significant in the upper troposphere where over a 7-day simulation it was of the order of 0.1-1% for midlatitudes at equinox. As the atmospheric loading of chlorine drops the gross odd-oxygen production by NO + HO2 will increase, so there will be an accelerated ozone recovery. On a per molecule basis, bromine-catalyzed methane oxidation is approximately 2 orders of magnitude faster than chlorine catalyzed methane oxidation. In the upper troposphere bromine-catalyzed methane oxidation destroys ozone at a rate which is approximately one: third of that at which nitrogen-catalyzed methane oxidation is producing ozone. Therefore, with the increasing atmospheric bromine loading, bromine-catalyzed methane oxidation is set to become more important. It would be valuable to have kinetic studies of the reaction BrO with CH3O2 so that the role of bromine-catalyzed methane oxidation can be quantified more precisely.},

	abstract     = {While phthalates in indoor environments are extensively studied, reports on phthalates in outdoor air, particularly their associations with haze weather events are rare. Phthalates, especially dimethyl phthalate, are known to react with criteria air pollutants contributing to the formation of secondary organic aerosols. This study investigated phthalates levels in the atmosphere in Shanghai with a focus on their associations with different air quality weather events. The air quality during the study period was classified into three levels: non-haze, light pollution and moderate pollution. Phthalates levels were found to be lower in non-haze weather events (236 ng/m3) and higher in moderate pollution weather events (up to 700 ng/m3). Meteorological factors of relative humidity and wind speed had an inverse relationship with phthalates levels. Particulate matter had a positive correlation with phthalates levels. Hydroxyl radical initiated photo-reaction of dimethyl phthalate was evident by its inverse relationship with total atmospheric oxidant (O3 + NO2), indicating that dimethyl phthalate could be one of the precursors of secondary organic aerosol causing haze weather events. Daily intake of phthalates through exposure to outdoor air is estimated to be relatively minor; children intake remains higher on a body weight basis. This is the first study demonstrating the relationship of phthalates and different air quality conditions in haze weather events. The knowledge contributes to our understanding on the cause of haze weather events in China and elsewhere.},

	abstract     = {Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is the termination of pregnancies, usually before 20 weeks of gestation, and is defined as the loss of two or more pregnancies. In Taiwan, after 2011 di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) exposure episode, more reproductive-aged women still expose to high levels of DEHP and di-butyl phthalate (DBP) than have women of other age groups. Phthalates might be involved in the RPL pathogenesis. This study assessed the association of phthalate exposure with RPL risk in reproductive-aged Taiwanese women. This study recruited 103 patients diagnosed by a physician with RPL of unknown etiology and 76 controls from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at a medical center in southern Taiwan between August 2013 and August 2017. Urine samples were analyzed for 11 phthalate metabolites through liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry; subsequently, principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis were performed to determine the main sources of phthalate exposure. Finally, multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the RPL risk. The creatinine-unadjusted median levels of mono-iso-butyl phthalate (MiBP), mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), and mono-(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (MECPP) in RPL/control were 9.8/5.3, 27.2/13.1, 11.4/8.1, and 12.9/9.5 ng/mL, respectively; furthermore, $\Sigma$DBPm and $\Sigma$DEHPm in RPL/control were 0.18/0.10 and 0.15/0.12 nmol/mL, respectively. PCA revealed three primary components of phthalate exposure: diethyl phthalates (DEP), DEHP, and DBP. Plastic food container use and medication were identified as the main phthalate exposure sources. After adjustment for potential confounding factors (urinary creatinine, age, age at menarche, education, and plastic food container use), we found that the urinary level of $\Sigma$DBPm was significantly associated with elevated risk for RPL (OR = 2.85, p = 0.045). Our findings supported the hypothesis that exposure to phthalates increases RPL risk. The development of a strategy to reduce phthalate exposure among reproductive-aged women should be emphasized. Phthalates exposure increase the risk of recurrent pregnancy loss.},

Plant volatiles are formed through many biochemical pathways, constitutively and after stress induction. In recent years, our understanding of the functions of these molecules has made constant and rapid progress. From being considered in the past as a mere waste of carbon, BVOCs have now emerged as an essential element of an invisible language that is perceived and exploited by the plants' enemies, the enemies of plant enemies, and neighbouring plants. In addition, BVOCs have important functions in protecting plants from abiotic stresses. Recent advances in our understanding of the role of BVOC in direct and indirect defences are driving further attention to these emissions. This special issue gathers some of the latest and most original research that further expands our knowledge of BVOC. BVOC emissions and functions in (1) unexplored terrestrial (including the soil) and marine environments, (2) in changing climate conditions, and (3) under anthropic pressures, or (4) in complex trophic communities are comprehensively reviewed. Stepping up from scientific awareness, the presented information shows that the manipulation and exploitation of BVOC is a realistic and promising strategy for agricultural applications and biotechnological exploitations. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

A simulation is conducted to encompass the growth and decay cycle of a supercell thunderstorm, with a focus on irreversible transport above the tropopause. Five previously published tropopause definitions are evaluated: World Meteorological Organization (WMO) temperature lapse rate, potential vorticity, static stability, vertical curvature of the Brunt-V{\"{a}}is{\"{a}}l{\"{a}} frequency, and stratospheric tracer concentration. By analyzing the behavior of different definitions both during and after active convection, we are able to define ''best'' choices for tropopause definitions as those that return to states most closely matching the preconvective environment. Potential vorticity and stratospheric tracer concentration are shown to perform poorly when analyzing deep convection. The WMO thermal tropopause and static stability definitions are found to perform the best, providing similar tropopause placement and quantities of irreversible mass transport. This investigation highlights the challenges of defining a tropopause in the vicinity of deep convection and demonstrates the need to clearly communicate calculation methods and threshold choices in the literature.},

There are many pollutants that are major factors in disease in humans. Among them, Particulate Matter (PM), particles of variable but very small diameter, penetrate the respiratory system via inhalation, causing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, reproductive and central nervous system dysfunctions, and cancer. Despite the fact that ozone in the stratosphere plays a protective role against ultraviolet irradiation, it is harmful when in high concentration at ground level, also affecting the respiratory and cardiovascular system. Furthermore, nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), dioxins, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are all considered air pollutants that are harmful to humans. Carbon monoxide can even provoke direct poisoning when breathed in at high levels. Heavy metals such as lead, when absorbed into the human body, can lead to direct poisoning or chronic intoxication, depending on exposure. Diseases occurring from the aforementioned substances include principally respiratory problems such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), asthma, bronchiolitis, and also lung cancer, cardiovascular events, central nervous system dysfunctions, and cutaneous diseases. Last but not least, climate change resulting from environmental pollution affects the geographical distribution of many infectious diseases, as do natural disasters. The only way to tackle this problem is through public awareness coupled with a multidisciplinary approach by scientific experts; national and international organizations must address the emergence of this threat and propose sustainable solutions.},

These effects are found, largely, in developing countries where people, especially women and young children, are exposed to high concentrations of smoke produced by biomass burning for cooking. Approximately 3 million deaths occur each year. In developed countries, the problem is much less acute: accidental exposure to high concentrations of carbon monoxide is the main cause of death. It should be remembered, however, that much of people's exposure to pollutants generated outdoors occurs in the indoor environment. Indoor exposure to particulate matter has the same effects as outdoor exposure: the cardiovascular system is most affected, with deaths being due to ischaemic heart disease and stroke. Exposure to particulate matter may also contribute to the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Exposure to high concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, although perhaps not having a great effect on measures of lung function, may contribute to the development of emphysema and reduce the resistance of the body to bacterial and viral infections. Lung cancer, due to exposure to carcinogens in wood smoke, also occurs. Efforts to reduce levels of indoor air pollution in developing countries, for example by providing flued cooking stoves, have been shown to reduce the prevalence of disease.},

	abstract     = {Increasing both crop productivity and the tolerance of crops to abiotic and biotic stresses is a major challenge for global food security in our rapidly changing climate. For the first time, we show how the spatial variation and severity of tropospheric ozone effects on yield compare with effects of other stresses on a global scale, and discuss mitigating actions against the negative effects of ozone. We show that the sensitivity to ozone declines in the order soybean > wheat > maize > rice, with genotypic variation in response being most pronounced for soybean and rice. Based on stomatal uptake, we estimate that ozone (mean of 2010–2012) reduces global yield annually by 12.4%, 7.1%, 4.4% and 6.1% for soybean, wheat, rice and maize, respectively (the “ozone yield gaps”), adding up to 227 Tg of lost yield. Our modelling shows that the highest ozone-induced production losses for soybean are in North and South America whilst for wheat they are in India and China, for rice in parts of India, Bangladesh, China and Indonesia, and for maize in China and the United States. Crucially, we also show that the same areas are often also at risk of high losses from pests and diseases, heat stress and to a lesser extent aridity and nutrient stress. In a solution-focussed analysis of these results, we provide a crop ideotype with tolerance of multiple stresses (including ozone) and describe how ozone effects could be included in crop breeding programmes. We also discuss altered crop management approaches that could be applied to reduce ozone impacts in the shorter term. Given the severity of ozone effects on staple food crops in areas of the world that are also challenged by other stresses, we recommend increased attention to the benefits that could be gained from addressing the ozone yield gap.},

We use mechanistic transmission models to derive predictions for how the probability and magnitude of transmission for Zika, chikungunya, and dengue change with mean temperature, and we show that these predictions are well matched by human case data. Across all three viruses, models and human case data both show that transmission occurs between 18–34°C with maximal transmission occurring in a range from 26–29°C. Controlling for population size and two socioeconomic factors, temperature-dependent transmission based on our mechanistic model is an important predictor of human transmission occurrence and incidence. Risk maps indicate that tropical and subtropical regions are suitable for extended seasonal or year-round transmission, but transmission in temperate areas is limited to at most three months per year even if vectors are present. Such brief transmission windows limit the likelihood of major epidemics following disease introduction in temperate zones.},

Molds and other\nmicrobial agents favor damp indoor environments, and excess moisture may\ninitiate the release of chemical emissions from damaged building materials\nand furnishings. This new book from the Institute of Medicine examines the\nhealth impact of exposures resulting from damp indoor environments and\noffers recommendations for public health interventions.\nDamp Indoor Spaces and Health covers a broad range of topics. The book\nnot only examines the relationship between damp or moldy indoor environments\nand adverse health outcomes but also discusses how and where\nbuildings get wet, how dampness influences microbial growth and chemical\nemissions, ways to prevent and remediate dampness, and elements of\na public health response to the issues. A comprehensive literature review\nfinds sufficient evidence of an association between damp indoor environments\nand some upper respiratory tract symptoms, coughing, wheezing,\nand asthma symptoms in sensitized persons. This important book will be of\ninterest to a wide-ranging audience of science, health, engineering, and\nbuilding professionals, government officials, and members of the public.}

	abstract     = {The indoor environment affects occupants' health and comfort. Poor environmental conditions and indoor contaminants are estimated to cost the U.S. economy tens of billions of dollars a year in exacerbation of illnesses like asthma, allergic symptoms, and subsequent lost productivity. Climate change has the potential to affect the indoor environment because conditions inside buildings are influenced by conditions outside them.\nClimate Change, the Indoor Environment, and Health addresses the impacts that climate change may have on the indoor environment and the resulting health effects. It finds that steps taken to mitigate climate change may cause or exacerbate harmful indoor environmental conditions. The book discusses the role the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) should take in informing the public, health professionals, and those in the building industry about potential risks and what can be done to address them. The study also recommends that building codes account for climate change projections; that federal agencies join to develop or refine protocols and testing standards for evaluating emissions from materials, furnishings, and appliances used in buildings; and that building weatherization efforts include consideration of health effects.\nClimate Change, the Indoor Environment, and Health is written primarily for the EPA and other federal agencies, organizations, and researchers with interests in public health; the environment; building design, construction, and operation; and climate issues.}

	abstract     = {People spend the vast majority of their time inside their homes and other indoor environments where they are exposed to a wide range of chemicals from building materials, furnishings, occupants, cooking, consumer products, and other sources. Despite research to date, very little is known about how exposures to indoor chemicals across complex chemical phases and pathways affect human health. The COVID-19 pandemic has only increased public awareness of indoor environments and shed light on the many outstanding questions about how best to manage chemicals indoors. This report identifies gaps in current research and understanding of indoor chemistry and new approaches that can be applied to measure, manage, and limit chemical exposures. Why Indoor Chemistry Matters calls for further research about the chemical transformations that can occur indoors, pathways and timing of indoor chemical exposure, and the cumulative and long-term impacts of exposure on human health. Research priorities should consider factors that contribute to measurable environmental health disparities that affect, vulnerable populations, such as the age, location, and condition of buildings that can alter exposures to indoor chemicals.}

The database contains photochemical data including absorption, fluorescence, photoelectron, and circular and linear dichroism spectra, as well as quantum yields and photolysis related data that are critically needed in many scientific disciplines. This manuscript gives an outline regarding the structure and content of the “science-softCon UV/Vis+ Photochemistry Database”. The accurate and reliable molecular level information provided in this database is fundamental in nature and helps in proceeding further to understand photon, electron and ion induced chemistry of molecules of interest not only in spectroscopy, astrochemistry, astrophysics, Earth and planetary sciences, environmental chemistry, plasma physics, combustion chemistry but also in applied fields such as medical diagnostics, pharmaceutical sciences, biochemistry, agriculture, and catalysis. In order to illustrate this, we illustrate the use of the UV/Vis+ Photochemistry Database in four different fields of scientific endeavor.},

As pollen and molds exhibit geographical variations, we sought to understand the impact of climate change (temperature, carbon dioxide (CO2), precipitation, smoke exposure) on common pollen and molds in the San Francisco Bay Area, one of the largest urban areas in the United States. When using time-series regression models between 2002 and 2019, the annual average number of weeks with pollen concentrations higher than zero increased over time. For tree pollens, the average increase in this duration was 0.47 weeks and 0.51 weeks for mold spores. Associations between mold, pollen and meteorological data (e.g., precipitation, temperature, atmospheric CO2, and area covered by wildfire smoke) were analyzed using the autoregressive integrated moving average model. We found that peak concentrations of weed and tree pollens were positively associated with temperature (p < 0.05 at lag 0–1, 0–4, and 0–12 weeks) and precipitation (p < 0.05 at lag 0–4, 0–12, and 0–24 weeks) changes, respectively. We did not find clear associations between pollen concentrations and CO2 levels or wildfire smoke exposure. This study's findings suggest that spore and pollen activities are related to changes in observed climate change variables.},

Distinct curves form in the polar vortex, the midlatitude "surf zones", and the tropics. Theory predicts such relationships for sufficiently rapid mixing along isentropic surfaces. Model results are used to illustrate the formation and seasonal evolution of distinct tracer relationships in the different regions. Using such relationships to associate departures from canonical forms with anomalous chemical or microphysical behavior must be done with care and with full awareness of the meteorological context of the data. Although the theory has been developed in the context of stratospheric tracers, the key requirement is that transport is predominantly two-dimensional. While the theory is thus inappropriate in the troposphere, it should be applicable to transport in the ocean interior. Copyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.},

	abstract     = {HVAC filters are commonly used to decrease exposure to particulate matter, yet little is known about the energy impacts and air quality consequences of high efficiency filters installed in commercial buildings. To explore these effects, system airflow, filter and coil pressure drop, fan pressure rise, and power draw were measured, and cooling capacity and compressor power were modeled for at least four filter pressure drops in 15 rooftop units equipped with and without fan speed control. Energy implications and clean-air-delivery-rate were estimated for a large dataset of filters divided into four efficiency (MERV) categories. Field measurements conducted on units without fan speed control showed that increased filter pressure drop decreased flow, cooling capacity, and power. For a unit with fan speed control, the same increase in pressure drop resulted in the same magnitude change of fan power but in the opposite direction, and other parameters were unchanged. Replacing MERV 8 with MERV 13/14 resulted in higher energy consumption (2–4%) during cooling mode for both unit types, energy savings during fan-only mode (8–13%) in units without fan speed control, and increased energy consumption in fan-only mode (11–18%) in the unit with fan speed control. Energy consumption increases were offset by improvement in clean-air-delivery-rate, especially for PM2.5 (2.9–3.8 times increase going from MERV 8 to MERV 13/14), with larger benefits achieved for the unit with fan speed control. A comprehensive understanding of the impact of filtration is essential to selecting the appropriate efficiency of filters that ensures low-energy use and a healthy indoor environment.}

There is a long list of indoor sources that can contribute to increased pollutant concentrations, some of them related to human activities (e.g. people's movement, cooking, cleaning, smoking), but also to surface chemistry reactions with human skin and building and furniture surfaces. The result of all these emissions is a heterogeneous cocktail of pollutants with varying degrees of toxicity, which makes indoor air quality a complex system. Good characterization of the sources that affect indoor air pollution levels is of major importance for quantifying (and reducing) the associated health risks. This chapter reviews some of the more significant indoor sources that can be found in the most common non-occupational indoor environments.},

However, several studies of the preva lence of symptoms point to the likelihood that greater use of air-conditioning in internal spaces leads to a larger number of complaints. The present paper deals with health aspects and complaints linked to the interaction between building, HVAC system, environment and occupant. HVAC-related factors are specially emphasized. In order to minimize the risk of complaints as much as possible, a number of recommendations or guidelines is given for each link in the building process, i.e. from design stage up to maintenance and manage ment. A quality assurance system for this building process is of utmost impor tance; therefore, policies and procedures have to be developed. {\textcopyright} 1993, Sage Publications.

	abstract     = {Because birds are conspicuous and easy to identify and count, reliable records of their occurrence have been gathered over many decades in many parts of the world. Drawing on such data for North America, Rosenberg et al. report wide-spread population declines of birds over the past half-century, resulting in the cumulative loss of billions of breeding individuals across a wide range of species and habitats. They show that declines are not restricted to rare and threatened species—those once considered common and wide-spread are also diminished. These results have major implications for ecosystem integrity, the conservation of wildlife more broadly, and policies associated with the protection of birds and native ecosystems on which they depend. Science, this issue p. 120 The cumulative loss of nearly 3 billion birds since 1970 across North American biomes signals a continuing avifaunal crisis. Species extinctions have defined the global biodiversity crisis, but extinction begins with loss in abundance of individuals that can result in compositional and functional changes of ecosystems. Using multiple and independent monitoring networks, we report population losses across much of the North American avifauna over 48 years, including once-common species and from most biomes. Integration of range-wide population trajectories and size estimates indicates a net loss approaching 3 billion birds, or 29\% of 1970 abundance. A continent-wide weather radar network also reveals a similarly steep decline in biomass passage of migrating birds over a recent 10-year period. This loss of bird abundance signals an urgent need to address threats to avert future avifaunal collapse and associated loss of ecosystem integrity, function, and services.}

	abstract     = {The most common airborne algae are recognized as a community of aeroalgae, and their morphological attributes and dimensions are associated to an average aerodynamic structure, called ideal airborne algae. The principal atmospheric factors producing the dispersion and viability of alga are briefly introduced. For the first time, in a systematic and consequent way, preprocessors of atmospheric parameters are used in aerobiology. The research indicates, at least statistically, that the synthesis of specific parameters in preprocessors is of a greater relevance for the dispersion of algae (and physically equivalent particles) than each one of the meteorological parameters by themselves. This synthesis introduces a theoretical - practical level of elaboration that allows a greater deepness of analysis. In this case, the adequate preprocessors of atmospheric movements are the turbulent kinetic energy and the evaporation. Another fundamental factor is the atmospheric pollution. In the southern metropolitan area of Mexico City the ozone represents an acceptable index of the levels of pollution limiting the viability of airborne algae. Under the assumption of a (steady) given supply of algae, a possible model of concentrations of algae in the atmosphere is constructed based on statistical considerations, aimed to predictions of those concentrations. {\textcopyright} 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract     = {Well-mixed atmospheric aqueous aerosol droplets containing multiple chemical species can undergo processes such as liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and crystallization depending on the ambient temperature and relative humidity (RH). So far, only a handful of single droplet studies have examined the effect of temperature in conjunction with the organic to inorganic ratio (OIR) on the separation RH for LLPS. In this work, we present a temperature-controlled microfluidic static trap approach to study the LLPS and efflorescence phenomenon in multiple ternary systems in a quasi-equilibrium manner. Ammonium sulfate or sodium chloride is used as the inorganic phase and 3-methylglutaric acid (3-MGA), poly(ethylene glycol), poly(propylene glycol), or poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate is used as the organic phase. Results show a clear trend in droplets containing 3-MGA with either salt of the initial LLPS and efflorescence events occurring at higher RH at lower temperatures, while this trend is less obvious for the other organics. The organic to inorganic ratio (OIR) of the system also affected the type of first phase transition, which can be either LLPS or efflorescence. Finally, the rate of RH change also had an impact on the temperature dependence of the formation of either anhydrous or dihydrous crystals of sodium chloride upon efflorescence. These results help inform the effects of temperature, OIR, and rate of RH change on the phase state of aqueous aerosol droplets containing multiple species.},

PM has been widely studied in the context of several diseases, and its role in lung carcinogenesis gained relevance due to an increase in cancer cases for which smoking does not seem to represent the main risk factor. According to epidemiological and toxicological evidence, PM acts as a carcinogenic factor in humans, inducing high rates of genomic alterations. Here, we discuss not only how PM is capable of inducing genomic instability during the carcinogenic process but also how our genetic background influences the response to the sources of damage.},

Analysis of seven soundings through strong updrafts of isolated supercell storms show that the basic E structure there has three |E| peaks: a positive peak near 8 km height, a negative peak near 10.5 km, and a positive peak near 12 km. Strong updraft soundings are those with average balloon ascent rates in excess of 10 m s-1. The basic charge structure in strong updrafts of supercells has four charge regions of alternating polarity. The lowermost charge is positive, between about 4 and 8 km, and the uppermost region is negative. All the supercell updraft soundings are incomplete due to balloon burst or lightning-induced instrument destruction below cloud top. Six supercell soundings that ascended outside strong updrafts are used to show that the E and charge structures there are more complex than within the strong updrafts. Analysis of 15 new or previously published soundings through small, New Mexican mountain thunderstorms indicates that the basic E structure in or near their convective cores consists of three |E| peaks: a lower positive peak at about 5 km height, a midlevel negative peak near 6.5 km, and an upper positive peak near 9.5 km. The basic charge structure near the center of New Mexican storm convection has four charge regions, alternating in polarity, with a positive charge region lowest. Soundings in New Mexican convection that did not ascend near the convective cores show more complex E profiles and charge structures. Copyright 1998 by the American Geophysical Union.},

	abstract     = {Objectives Outdoor air pollution is a serious environmental problem worldwide. Current systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) mostly focused on some specific health outcomes or some specific air pollution. Design This evidence gap map (EGM) is to identify existing gaps from SRs and MAs and report them in broad topic areas. Data sources PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus and Web of Science were searched from their inception until June 2018. Citations and reference lists were traced. Eligibility criteria SRs and MAs that investigated the impact of outdoor air pollution on human health outcomes were collected. This study excluded original articles and qualitative review articles. Data extraction and synthesis Characteristics of the included SRs and MAs were extracted and summarised. Extracted data included authors, publication year, location of the corresponding author(s), publication journal discipline, study design, study duration, sample size, study region, target population, types of air pollution and health outcomes. Results Asia and North America published 93% of SRs and MAs included in this EGM. 31% of the SRs and MAs (27/86) included primary studies conducted in 5-10 countries. Their publication trends have increased during the last 10 years. A total of 2864 primary studies was included. The median number of included primary studies was 20 (range, 7-167). Cohort studies, case cross-over studies and time-series studies were the top three most used study designs. The mostly researched population was the group of all ages (46/86, 53%). Cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases and health service records were mostly reported. A lack of definite diagnostic criteria, unclear reporting of air pollution exposure and time period of primary studies were the main research gaps. Conclusions This EGM provided a visual overview of health outcomes affected by outdoor air pollution exposure. Future research should focus on chronic diseases, cancer and mental disorders.},

Due to the potential exposure to phthalates in office rooms, their concentrations in the air of these premises after their renovation and furnishing were determined. The aim of the study was to determine the content of these compounds in the gas phase and adsorbed on the particles. Thus, the combined sampler with filters and adsorption tube was used for air sampling. Samples were analyzed by GC-MS. The gas fraction was dominated by dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), and the inhalable fraction by dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and 2-(diethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). The total concentration of phthalates in the respirable fraction in the furnished rooms was as much as 92% of the phthalates determined in the inhalable fraction. In the rooms immediately after renovation and those arranged and used by employees for 7 months, their concentration in the respirable fraction did not exceed 25% of the phthalates in the inhalable fraction. Phthalate concentration in the renovated rooms after 7 months of their usage dropped by 84% in relation to PAEs concentration in newly arranged rooms and by 68% in relation to the phthalate concentration in empty rooms.},

	abstract     = {Background: The International Agency for Research on Cancer classified both outdoor air pollution and airborne particulate matter as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) for lung cancer. There may be associations with cancer at other sites; however, the epidemiological evidence is limited. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to clarify whether ambient air pollution is associated with specific types of cancer other than lung cancer by examining associations of ambient air pollution with nonlung cancer death in the Cancer Prevention Study II (CPS-II). Methods: Analysis included 623,048 CPS-II participants who were followed for 22 y (1982-2004). Modeled estimates of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5) (1999-2004), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) (2006), and ozone (O3) (2002-2004) concentrations were linked to the participant residence at enrollment. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate associations per each fifth percentile-mean increment with cancer mortality at 29 anatomic sites, adjusted for individual and ecological covariates. Results: We observed 43,320 nonlung cancer deaths. PM2 5 was significantly positively associated with death from cancers of the kidney {adjusted hazard ratio (HR) per 4.4 $\mu$g/m3 = 1.14 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03, 1.27]} and bladder [HR = 1.13 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.23)]. NO2 was positively associated with colorectal cancer mortality [HR per 6.5ppb = 1.06 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.10). The results were similar in two-pollutant models including PM2 5 and NO2 and in three-pollutant models with O3. We observed no statistically significant positive associations with death from other types of cancer based on results from adjusted models. Conclusions: The results from this large prospective study suggest that ambient air pollution was not associated with death from most nonlung cancers, but associations with kidney, bladder, and colorectal cancer death warrant further investigation.},

With these tracers we trace back the origin of young air masses (age<span class="thinspace"></span><<span class="thinspace"></span>6 months) at the top of the Asian monsoon anticyclone and of air masses within the tropical pipe (6 months<span class="thinspace"></span><<span class="thinspace"></span>age<span class="thinspace"></span><<span class="thinspace"></span>18 months) during summer 2008. The occurrence of young air masses (<<span class="thinspace"></span>6 months) at the top of the Asian monsoon anticyclone up to &approx;<span class="thinspace"></span>460<span class="thinspace"></span>K is in agreement with satellite measurements of chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC-22) by the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) instrument. HCFC-22 can be considered as a regional tracer for continental eastern Asia and the Near East as it is mainly emitted in this region. </p> <p>Our findings show that the transport pathway of air masses from boundary sources in the region of the Asian monsoon into the tropical pipe occurs in three distinct steps. First, very fast uplift in <q>a convective range</q> transports air masses up to 360<span class="thinspace"></span>K potential temperature within a few days. Second, air masses are uplifted from about 360<span class="thinspace"></span>K up to 460<span class="thinspace"></span>K within <q>an upward spiralling range</q> within a few months. The large-scale upward spiral extends from northern Africa to the western Pacific. The air masses are transported upwards by diabatic heating with a rate of up to 1&ndash;1.5<span class="thinspace"></span>K per day, implying strong vertical transport above the Asian monsoon anticyclone. Third, transport of air masses occurs within the tropical pipe up to 550<span class="thinspace"></span>K associated with the large-scale Brewer&ndash;Dobson circulation within $\sim$<span class="thinspace"></span>one year.</p> <p>In the upward spiralling range, air masses are uplifted by diabatic heating across the (lapse rate) tropopause, which does not act as a transport barrier under these conditions. Further, in the upward spiralling range air masses from inside the Asian monsoon anticyclone are mixed with air masses convectively uplifted outside the core of the Asian monsoon anticyclone in the tropical adjacent regions. However, this upward transport is weak in terms of transported air masses compared to the quasi-horizontal transport from the monsoon anticyclone into the northern lower stratosphere and tropical tropopause region. Air masses from the Asian monsoon anticyclone (India/China) contribute a minor fraction to the composition of air within the tropical pipe at 550<span class="thinspace"></span>K (6<span class="thinspace"></span>%), the major fractions are from Southeast Asia (16<span class="thinspace"></span>%) and the tropical Pacific (15<span class="thinspace"></span>%).</p>},

This chapter reviews and updates the state of knowledge on indoor aerosols with a focus on their behaviour, physicochemical properties and implications for health assessment studies. It begins with a brief outline of fundamental aerosol dynamics (i.e. deposition, coagulation, evaporation and nucleation) and the main factors that control and affect the concentration and behaviour of aerosols indoors. It then summarizes the concentrations and physicochemical profiles of aerosols in different major indoor sources and microenvironments such as homes, offices and schools. Implications of particle properties for lung dose calculations are discussed. Based on this work, it is concluded that indoor aerosols show a range of particle size distributions and chemical compositions, depending on different indoor emissions and aerosol indoor dynamics. Household aerosols are identified as a main contributor to the total and regional lung dose of ambient particles, especially when expressed by number dose.},

	abstract     = {Some phthalates, which are used mainly as plasticizers, are suspected to be endocrine disruptors. In the present study, daily intakes of phthalates by Japanese children through all exposure pathways and the contribution of indoor air quality to the intakes were examined by measuring urinary phthalate metabolites in the children and the airborne phthalates in their residences. Spot urine samples excreted first after waking up in the morning were collected from the subjects aged 6 to 15 years (n = 132), and airborne phthalates were sampled in the subjects' bedrooms for 24 h. Eight airborne phthalates and their urinary metabolites were determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The daily intakes of the phthalates estimated were as follows (median, $\mu$g/kg b.w./day): dimethyl phthalate (DMP), 0.15; diethyl phthalate (DEP), 0.42; diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP), 1.1; di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), 2.2; dicyclohexyl phthalate (DcHP), 0.026; benzylbutyl phthalate (BBzP), 0.032; di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), 6.3. The 95th percentile (21 $\mu$g/kg b.w./day) of the DEHP intakes exceeded the reference doses (RfD, 20 $\mu$g/kg b.w./day) of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). DEHP was suggested to be the most notable phthalate from the perspective of adverse effects on the health of Japanese children. On the other hand, DcHP and di-n-hexyl phthalate were not considered to be very important as indoor air pollutants and as internal contaminants for the children. The contribution rates of the amounts absorbed by inhalation to the amounts absorbed via all of the exposure pathways were only 7.9, 4.4, 6.6, 3.2, 0.22, and 1.0% as the median for DMP, DEP, DiBP, DnBP, BBzP, and DEHP, respectively. Therefore, inhalation did not seem to contribute very much as an absorption pathway of the phthalates for Japanese children while at home.},

As Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling of combustion becomes increasingly important, so do chemical kinetic mechanisms for methane combustion. Kinetic mechanisms of different complexity exist, and the aim of this study is to review commonly used detailed, reduced, and global mechanisms of importance for CFD of methane combustion. In this review, procedures of relevance to model development are outlined. Simulations of zero and one-dimensional configurations have been performed over a wide range of conditions, including addition of H2, CO2 and H2O, and the results are used in a final recommendation about the use of the different mechanisms. The aim of this review is to put focus on the importance of an informed choice of kinetic mechanism to obtain accurate results at a reasonable computational cost. It is shown that for flame simulations, a reduced mechanism with only 42 irreversible reactions gives excellent agreement with experimental data, using only 5% of the computational time as compared to the widely used GRI-Mech 3.0. The reduced mechanisms are highly suitable for flame simulations, while for ignition they tend to react too slow, giving longer than expected ignition delay time. For combustible mixtures with addition of hydrogen, carbon dioxide, or water, the detailed as well as reduced mechanisms generally show as good performance as for the corresponding simulations of pure methane/air mixtures.},
